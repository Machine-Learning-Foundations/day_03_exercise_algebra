## Linear Algebra Exercise
Welcome to the exercise repository for day 3 of our course.
To help you, we have prepared unit-tests.
Use:
```shell
nox -s test
```
While coding, use `nox -s lint`, and `nox -s typing` to check your code.
Autoformatting help is available via `nox -s format`.
Feel free to read more about nox at https://nox.thea.codes/en/stable/ .


### Part 1: Proof of concept
Use `b = pandas.read_csv('./data/noisy_signal.tab')` to load a noisy signal.
The first part will be concerned with modeling this signal using polynomials.

#### Regression
Linear regression is usually a good first step. Start by implementing the function
`set_up_point_matrix` from the `src/regularization.py` module. 
The function should produce polynomial-coordinate matrices $\mathbf{A}_m$ of the form:

$$
\mathbf{A}_m = 
\begin{pmatrix}
          1       & x_1^1    & x_1^2  & \dots & x_1^m  \\\\ 
          1       & x_2^1    & x_2^2  & \dots & x_2^m  \\\\
          1       & x_3^1    & x_3^2  & \dots & x_3^m  \\\\
          \vdots  & \vdots   & \vdots  & \ddots & \vdots \\\\ 
          1       & x_n^1    & x_n^2  & \dots & x_n^m  \\\\
   \end{pmatrix}
$$

With m=2,

$$\mathbf{A}_m^{\dagger}\mathbf{b} = \mathbf{x}$$

will produce the coefficients for a straight line. Evaluate your first-degree polynomial via ax+b.
Plot the result using `matplotlib.pyplot`'s `plot` function.


#### Fitting a Polynomial to a function
The straight line above is insufficient to model the data. Using your 
implementation of `set_up_point_matrix` set n=300 and fit the polynomial
by computing

$$\mathbf{A}^{\dagger}\mathbf{b} = \mathbf{x}_{\text{fit}}.$$

Having estimated the coefficients

$$\mathbf{A} \mathbf{x}_{\text{fit}}$$

computes the function values. Plot the original points and the function values using matplotlib.
What do you see?



#### Regularization
Unfortunately, the fit is not ideal. The polynomial tracks the noise.
The singular value decomposition (SVD) can help!
Recall that the SVD turns a matrix

$$\mathbf{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{m,n}$$

into the form:

$$
      \mathbf{A}
      = \mathbf{U} \Sigma \mathbf{V}^T 
      = \mathbf{U}
      \begin{pmatrix}
      \sigma_1 & & \\\\
      & \ddots &  \\\\
      & & \sigma_m \\\\ \hline 
      & 0 & \\\\
      \end{pmatrix} \mathbf{V}^T
$$

In the SVD-Form computing, the inverse is simple. Swap U and V  and replace every of the m singular values with it's inverse

$$1/\sigma_i .$$

A solution to the overfitting problem is to filter the singular values.
Compute a diagonal for a filter matrix by evaluating:

$$f_i = \sigma_i^2 / (\sigma_i^2 + \epsilon)$$

The idea is to compute a loop over i for all of the m singular values.
Roughly speaking multiplication by f underscore i will filter a singular value when

$$\sigma_i &lt; \epsilon .$$

Apply the regularization by computing:


$$
    \mathbf{x}_r= \mathbf{V} \mathbf{F} \begin{pmatrix}
      \sigma_1^{-1} & & & \\\\
      &  \ddots & \\\\
      &  & \sigma_m^{-1} \\\\ \hline
      & 0 &
    \end{pmatrix}
    \mathbf{U}^T \mathbf{b}
$$


with

$$\mathbf{A} \in \mathbb{R}^{m,n}, \mathbf{U} \in \mathbb{R}^{m,m}, \mathbf{V} \in \mathbb{R}^{n,n}, \mathbf{F} \in \mathbb{R}^{m,m}, \Sigma^{\dagger} \in \mathbb{R}^{n,m} \text{ and } \mathbf{b} \in \mathbb{R}^{n,1}.$$
  
Setting m=300 turns A into a square matrix. In this case the zero block in the sigma-matrix disappears.
Plot the result for epsilon equal to 0.1, 1e-6, and 1e-12.


### Part 2: Rhine water level analysis
Now we are ready to deal with real data!
The file `./data/pegel.tab` contains the Rhine water levels from the last 100 years as measured in Bonn.

#### Regression
The `src/pegel_bonn.py` file already contains code to pre-load the data for you.
Make the Rhine level measurements your new vector $\mathbf{b}$.
Generate a matrix A by setting m=2 and compute 

$$\mathbf{A}^{\dagger}\mathbf{b}.$$

Plot the result. Compute the zero. When do the regression line and the x-Axis intersect?

#### Fitting a higher order Polynomial

Re-using the code you wrote for the proof of concept task fit a polynomial of degree 20 to the data.
Plot the result.


#### Regularization
Something happened around the year 2000. To investigate further, focus on the data from 2000 onward and
filter the singular values.
Matrix A is not square in this case. Consequently, a zero block must appear in your singular value matrix matrix. 
Plot filtered eigen-polynomials using epsilon equal to 0.1, 1e-3, 1e-9.
